# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Using Tableau

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to design a dynamic Tableau dashboard to analyze key Electric Vehicle (EV) metrics and trends across various dimensions. The dashboard enables users to:
‚Ä¢	Track Total Electric Vehicles (EVs), including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).<br>

‚Ä¢	Understand the average electric range of EVs to assess technological advancements.<br>

‚Ä¢	Analyze the state-wise distribution of EVs using geographic visualizations.<br>

‚Ä¢	Identify top manufacturers and models dominating the EV market.<br>

‚Ä¢	Assess the impact of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility on EV adoption.<br>

## Dataset Used

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Vehicles

Understand the overall EV landscape, tracking both BEVs and PHEVs to measure market growth.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Average Electric Range

Determine the average driving range of EVs to evaluate battery technology improvements.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Total BEV Vehicles & Percentage of Total BEVs

Identify the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs).

Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to all EVs to assess the market dominance of fully electric models.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Total PHEV Vehicles & Percentage of Total PHEVs

Identify the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to all EVs to understand hybrid adoption trends.
